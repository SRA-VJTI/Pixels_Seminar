# Pixels Assignment 1

In this assignment you will peactise problems based on the concepts of arrays, pointers, relationship of arrays and pointers and vectors.

## Basic of C++

 Fun with pointers.

**Q1** A teacher awards each student with 3 candies at the start of the day. Each time a student misbehaves she takes away 2 candies from them and awards them with an extra candy when they perform well in their tests. There are 4 students in the class.
WAP to help the teacher distribute the right number of candies.

**Expected Output**

*Hint U can use the recently taught concepts of pointer arithmetics*

Q2  A shopkeeper keeps a record of his inventory. Write a program to help him change the stock as and when the orders are placed. Too easy right 😉.Let's make things more interesting 😀. Use the concept of pointers to access this two-dimensional array.


**Output is similar to that in Q1**


| Unique ID of good |Price | In Stock  |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
|0001      |250       |10        |
|0002      |500       |20        |
|0003      |1000      |30        |
|0004      |1500      |40        |

*Hint an array is stored in a continuous block of memory 😉

**Q3** Lets us build upon our knowledge of pointers and arrays even further. Create a Print function that prints out the entire two-dimensional array. (Pass a pointer array to the  function)

**Sample Input**

****EXTRA SPECIAL BROWNIE POINTS Question****
Write a similar function but print only the price of the items(use a pointer to a single element of the array)


**Q4** We have learned the concepts of vectors now lets use them to render vectors which represent images


** Hint we can represent black pixels by 0 and white ones by 1. lets say for a image with 5X5 size

**Q5** Now copy the vector into a new vector and render an inverted vector wherein black is on top and white is at the bottom. 🤗
