# PIXELS

`PIXELS` is an introduction to Computer Vision and Image Processing. Similar to a `pixel` which is the fundamental unit of any digital image, the objective is to emphasise the fundamental ideas of image and its algorithm in relation to contemporary technologies, such as the industry standard `OpenCV`. A thorough understanding of the fundamentals can aid in research and system redesign for domain-specific optimisations to meet the hardware needs of edge devices.

Every program is written in `C++` to provide the flexibility required by programmers. It also includes principles of essential development tools such as `Make` and `Git`.

### The aim of this repository is to provide:  
- A brief idea of algorithms involved in **Computer Vision** . 
- Introduction to Version Control System: **Git** and **GitHub**. 
- Computer Vision and Image Processing basics, idea of implementation of various algorithms involved from scratch (instead of any dedicated image processing library like OpenCV.)
- Introduction to a commonly used Image Processing Library: **OpenCV**
- Functionality of **Blob detection** using ROI (Region of Interest).
